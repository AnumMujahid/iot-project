## Fitness Tracker

An embedded system has been developed using an integrated pulse oximetry and heart rate monitor biosensor module i.e., MAX30102 with NodeMCU, which has an open-source hardware and software development environment built around SoC (System on Chip) i.e., ESP8266. It is an excellent choice for an Internet of Things (IoT) project as it is cost effective and contains all crucial elements of a computer: Central Processing Unit (CPU), RAM, networking module (WIFI), modern operating system and SDK. The pulse monitoring helps in determining the heart rate i.e., number of times heart beats per minute (bpm). The pulse rate varies from minute to minute, it will be faster when someone running, doing exercise, has fever or are under stress and will be slow when resting. This data is of important nature as the function of heart is directly related to heart rate and stroke volume. In order to store and synchronize the real time data generated by sensor, a cloud hosted NoSQL Firebase database has been used. It stores all the data in JSON format that can be query later on for analysis and visualization purposes. A react app was developed to output bpm and view with the charts and routes. The visualization of bpm data can help in determining heart disease or another problem as treatment of most of the heart-related issues requires continuous as well as long term monitoring. The health professionals can be more watchful and connect with patients proactively.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository
- Go to nodemcu_code/max30102_project.ino and configure firebase and wifi settings.
- Upload this code to nodemcu.
- Go to src directory and create firebaseConfig.js file.
- Add firebase credentials in it.
- Run command **npm install**.
- Run command **npm start**.
